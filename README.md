# Email Tracking System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Email Tracking System project! This application allows users to track how many recipients open the emails they send. Using a simple yet effective technique known as the dead pixel method, this system provides insightful data on email engagement, enabling users to optimize their communication strategies. Whether you're a marketer, a business owner, or just someone looking to understand their email interactions better, this project will help you gain valuable insights into your email campaigns.

## Motivation

The inspiration for this project arose from my experience using [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), a popular email marketing platform. I found it fascinating that I could track how many recipients opened my emails, which gave me a clearer picture of my audience's engagement. However, I wanted to create a simpler, self-hosted solution that allows individuals to monitor their email opens without relying on third-party services. Thus, I set out to build this Email Tracking System using the dead pixel technique.

## Dead Pixel Technique

The dead pixel technique is a straightforward yet effective method for tracking email opens. Here's how it works:

1. **Invisible Pixel:** An image, usually a 1x1 pixel transparent GIF, is embedded in the email. This image is hosted on a server that you control.

2. **Image Request:** When a recipient opens the email, their email client attempts to load the embedded image from your server.

3. **Tracking:** Each time the image is requested, you can log the event in your database, capturing information such as the time of the request, the recipient's IP address, and potentially their geographic location.

4. **Data Analysis:** With this data, you can analyze engagement metrics, track open rates, and gather insights about your email campaigns.

By implementing this technique, you can gain a deeper understanding of how your emails are performing and make data-driven decisions to improve your communication efforts.
